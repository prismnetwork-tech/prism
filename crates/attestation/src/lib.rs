//! Verification of hardware attestation for the Prism control plane.
//!
//! Three verifiers live here. The NVIDIA one reads a device report and says
//! which physical GPU answered and what firmware it runs. The SEV-SNP one
//! reads a report a guest took of itself and says what image that VM was
//! launched from, on which processor, at which patch level. The TDX one does
//! the same for a TD, and additionally replays the runtime event log that
//! binds the TD to the workload it is running.
//!
//! The crate is a pure function over bytes: no network, no clock, no I/O beyond
//! the vendor roots and the reference values compiled into it. Either every
//! check passes and the evidence earns a class, or nothing is returned at all.
//! There is no path that yields a verdict on partial evidence.
